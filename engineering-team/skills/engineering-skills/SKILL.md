description: "Plugin index and orchestration router for the 23-skill engineering-team family covering architecture, frontend, backend, QA, DevOps, security, AI/ML, data engineering, Playwright, Stripe, AWS, Azure, GCP, and MS365. Triggers include \"engineering-skills overview,\" \"what engineering skills are available,\" \"list engineering tools,\" \"engineering capabilities,\" \"engineering plugin help,\" \"what can the engineering plugin do,\" \"orchestrate engineering review.\" Relevant for Mo: this is the umbrella under which technical work for Curb (iOS plus web, dual SKU), Mo platform (Next.js plus Supabase, psychology-first matching), askminimo (Next.js, $19.99/mo agent SaaS), Lighthouse (TypeScript marketing automation), and the Personal-Website- repo (maureencappallo.com) gets routed. 30+ Python tools, stdlib-only, no paid API dependencies. Pair with senior-architect for cross-cutting design decisions and tdd-guide for the discipline layer underneath."

## Python Tools

30+ scripts, all stdlib-only. Run directly:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/<tool>.py --help
```

No pip install needed. Scripts include embedded samples for demo mode.

## Rules

- Load only the specific skill SKILL.md you need — don't bulk-load all 23
- Use Python tools for analysis and scaffolding, not manual judgment
- Check CLAUDE.md for tool usage examples and workflows
