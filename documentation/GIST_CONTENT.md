## 💡 Common Questions & Answers

### What is a Claude Skill?

A Claude Skill is a modular package of instructions, scripts, and resources that teaches Claude AI how to perform specific tasks with domain expertise. Skills are folders containing:
- **SKILL.md** - Instructions following Anthropic's Agent Skills Specification
- **scripts/** - Python automation tools (optional)
- **references/** - Knowledge bases and frameworks (optional)
- **assets/** - Templates and resources (optional)

### How do I use these skills?

**For Claude.ai Users:**

3. Run Python tools directly: `python scripts/tool.py`

**For Claude API Users:**
1. Use Skills API to upload skills
2. Reference in API calls
3. Automate workflows programmatically

### What makes these skills different from prompts?

**Skills vs Prompts:**
- **Skills** = Reusable, structured, versioned expertise with automation tools
- **Prompts** = One-time instructions that must be rewritten each time

**Skills provide:**
- Consistent, repeatable results
- Python automation (deterministic, fast)
- Progressive disclosure (load references as needed)
- Team sharing via git
- Version control and updates
- Professional metadata and licensing

### Which skills provide the highest ROI?

**Top ROI Skills by Function:**

**Marketing:** Content Creator → $1.2M/year (210 hrs/month saved)
**Engineering:** Complete suite (14 skills) → $5M/year (740 hrs/month saved)
**Product:** Product Manager Toolkit → $800K/year (90 hrs/month saved)
**Regulatory:** Complete RA/QM suite (12 skills) → $5M/year (320 hrs/month saved)
**Project Management:** Complete suite (6 skills) → $2.3M/year (200 hrs/month saved)

- ✅ Distribution to teams/clients
- ✅ Private use
- ✅ Creating derivative works

**No restrictions**, just include the copyright notice and license.

### Do I need Python experience?

**For using skills:** No - Skills work with Claude AI/Code without Python knowledge

**For running automation tools:** Basic Python helpful but not required
- Most tools have simple command-line interfaces
- `--help` flags explain usage
- Clear documentation for each tool
- Can use skills without running Python scripts

**For contributing:** Python knowledge needed only for creating new automation tools

### Which skill should I start with?

**Depends on your role:**

**Marketer?** → Start with `content-creator` (brand voice, SEO, social media)
**CEO/Executive?** → Start with `ceo-advisor` (strategy, board governance)
**CTO/Tech Lead?** → Start with `cto-advisor` (tech debt, team scaling)
**Product Manager?** → Start with `product-manager-toolkit` (RICE, interviews, PRDs)
**Engineer?** → Start with `senior-fullstack` (project scaffolding, code quality)
**HealthTech/MedTech?** → Start with `regulatory-affairs-head` (EU MDR, FDA)

**Solo founder wearing many hats?** → Get all 42 skills for complete coverage

### How do skills activate in Claude?

**Skills are model-invoked (automatic):**
- Claude reads skill descriptions
- When your request matches the description, Claude uses the skill
