- **Impact**: How much will this move the needle?
- **Confidence**: How sure are you it will work?
- **Ease**: How easy is it to implement?

**Example Tests** (sorted by ICE score):

| Test | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE | Priority |
|------|--------|------------|------|-----|----------|
| CTA button color (red vs. green) | 3 | 8 | 10 | 7.0 | Low |
| Landing page headline rewrite | 8 | 7 | 8 | 7.7 | Medium |
| Pricing page redesign | 9 | 6 | 4 | 6.3 | Medium |
| New lead magnet offer | 9 | 8 | 7 | 8.0 | High |
| Add live chat to pricing page | 7 | 9 | 8 | 8.0 | High |

### 6.2 Test Design & Execution

**Test Template**:
```
Hypothesis: [Adding a case study carousel to the pricing page will increase demo requests by 20% because users need social proof before committing]

Metric: [Demo requests from /pricing page]
Sample Size: [1000 visitors per variant]
Duration: [2 weeks or until significance]
Success Criteria: [20% lift, 95% confidence]

Variant A (Control): [Current pricing page]
Variant B (Treatment): [Pricing page + case study carousel]

Tools: [HubSpot A/B test, or Google Optimize]
```

**Statistical Significance**:
- Minimum: 95% confidence, 1000 visitors/variant
- Use calculator: Optimizely Sample Size Calculator
- Don't stop tests early (false positives)

**Test Velocity** (Series A target):
- 4-6 tests/month across channels
- 70% win rate not realistic (aim for 30-40%)
- Document losers (learnings matter)

### 6.3 Common Experiments

**Landing Page Tests**:
- Headline variations (problem-focused vs. solution-focused)
- CTA copy ("Start Free Trial" vs. "Get Started" vs. "Try Now")
- Form length (5 fields vs. 2 fields)
- Social proof placement (above vs. below fold)
- Hero image (product screenshot vs. people vs. abstract)

**Ad Tests**:
- Creative format (static vs. video vs. carousel)
- Messaging angle (feature-led vs. benefit-led vs. outcome-led)
- Audience targeting (broad vs. narrow)
- Landing page destination (homepage vs. dedicated LP)

**Email Tests**:
- Subject line length (short vs. long)
- Personalization (generic vs. first name vs. company name)
- Send time (morning vs. afternoon vs. evening)
- CTA placement (top vs. middle vs. bottom)

## 7. Handoff Protocols

### 7.1 MQL → SQL Handoff (Marketing → Sales)

**SQL Definition Criteria** (customize for your ICP):
```
Required:
✅ Job title: Director+ (or Budget Authority confirmed)
✅ Company size: 50-5000 employees
✅ Budget: $10k+ annual (or Qualified Need confirmed)
✅ Timeline: Buying within 90 days
✅ Engagement: Demo requested OR High intent action

Optional:
✅ Industry: Target verticals
✅ Geography: US/CA/EU
✅ Use case: Matches product capabilities
```

**HubSpot Workflow**:
1. Lead reaches MQL threshold (lead score >75)
2. Trigger: Automated email to SDR
3. SDR qualification call (BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
4. If qualified → Mark as SQL, assign to AE
5. If not qualified → Recycle to nurture, adjust lead score

**SLA** (Service Level Agreement):
- SDR responds to MQL: 4 hours
- AE books demo with SQL: 24 hours
- First demo: Within 3 business days of SQL status

### 7.2 SQL → Opportunity Handoff (Sales → RevOps)

**Opportunity Creation**:
- AE creates opportunity in HubSpot after first demo
- Required fields: Company, Deal value, Close date, Stage
- Pipeline stages: Discovery → Demo → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost

**Marketing Support Post-SQL**:
- Retargeting ads to target accounts (ABM)
- Send case studies, ROI calculator
- Invite to customer webinar
- Executive briefing (for Enterprise deals)

### 7.3 Lost Opportunity Handoff (Sales → Marketing)

**Recycle to Nurture**:
- Reason: No budget, bad timing, wrong fit
- Action: Move to "Nurture" list in HubSpot
- Sequence: Quarterly check-in emails, invite to webinars
- Re-engage: After 6-12 months, SDR re-qualification

**Closed Lost Reasons** (track in HubSpot):
- Price too high
- Missing features
- Chose competitor
- No budget
- Bad timing
- Champion left company

**Use lost reasons to inform**:
- Product roadmap
- Pricing changes
- Competitive positioning
- Messaging adjustments
