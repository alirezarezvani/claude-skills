## üìä Executive Summary

### Current State Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ 36 production-ready skills with comprehensive domain expertise
- ‚úÖ 97 Python automation tools
- ‚úÖ Excellent reference materials and frameworks
- ‚úÖ Real-world benchmarks and best practices

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SKILL.md files too long (200-1,000 lines vs. recommended 50-200)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing metadata (license, version, category)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No keywords sections for better discovery
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not using allowed-tools for security/safety
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some skills too broad (covering multiple capabilities)

### Expected Improvements

**After Refactoring:**
- ‚úÖ Faster skill loading (50-70% reduction in SKILL.md size)
- ‚úÖ Better Claude activation (clearer triggers)
- ‚úÖ Professional metadata (license, versioning, categorization)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced discovery (keywords sections)
- ‚úÖ Safer execution (allowed-tools restrictions)
- ‚úÖ Maintained expertise (moved to references/, not deleted)

**ROI:**
- Implementation time: ~40 hours
- Benefit: Permanent improvement to all 36 skills
- User impact: Better Claude performance, clearer documentation

## üéØ Refactoring Principles

### Following Anthropic's Official Pattern

1. **Focused Scope** - One skill = one clear capability (not entire domains)
2. **Lean SKILL.md** - 50-200 lines (core instructions only)
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Metadata ‚Üí SKILL.md ‚Üí References ‚Üí Scripts
4. **Rich Descriptions** - What + When + Triggers + Keywords
5. **Proper Metadata** - License, version, category tracking
6. **Tool Restrictions** - Use allowed-tools for safety when appropriate
7. **Keywords Section** - Help users discover skills

### What NOT to Change

- ‚úÖ Keep all Python scripts (they're excellent)
- ‚úÖ Keep all reference materials (move to references/)
- ‚úÖ Keep all frameworks and benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Keep domain expertise (just reorganize)
- ‚úÖ Keep current folder structure (already good)

### Optimization Strategy

**Move FROM SKILL.md:**
- Detailed frameworks (reference in 1-2 sentences, full content in references/)
- Extensive examples (keep 1-2, move rest to references/examples.md)
- Long procedural guides (summarize, detail in references/)
- Comprehensive checklists (link to references/)

**Keep IN SKILL.md:**
- Quick start guide (3-5 examples)
- Core workflow overview (high-level steps)
- When to use each script/reference (pointers)
- Essential decision points
- Keywords for discovery

**Move to References:**
- Detailed RICE methodology ‚Üí `references/rice-prioritization-guide.md`
- Interview frameworks ‚Üí `references/customer-discovery-methods.md`
- Full PRD templates ‚Üí Already in references/ ‚úÖ
- Extensive metrics frameworks ‚Üí `references/product-metrics-frameworks.md`

**Refined Structure:**
```markdown
# Product Manager Toolkit

## Keywords
[as above]

## Quick Start

Three core capabilities, pick yours:

### Feature Prioritization
```bash
python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20
```

### Interview Analysis
```bash
python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
```

### PRD Creation
Use templates from references/prd_templates.md

## Core Workflows

### 1. Feature Prioritization
Score features with RICE framework:
1. Gather feature requests
2. Score with RICE (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence / Effort)
3. Generate roadmap

For complete RICE methodology, see [references/rice-prioritization-guide.md](references/rice-prioritization-guide.md).

### 2. Customer Discovery
Extract insights from interviews:
1. Conduct interviews
2. Analyze with customer_interview_analyzer.py
3. Synthesize findings

For interview frameworks and methodologies, see [references/customer-discovery-methods.md](references/customer-discovery-methods.md).

### 3. PRD Development
Document requirements:
1. Choose template from references/prd_templates.md
2. Fill sections based on discovery
3. Collaborate with stakeholders

## Scripts

### rice_prioritizer.py
Calculate RICE scores and generate roadmaps.
- Usage: `python scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20`
- Output: Prioritized list, portfolio analysis, roadmap

### customer_interview_analyzer.py
Extract insights from interview transcripts.
- Usage: `python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt`
- Output: Pain points, feature requests, themes, sentiment

## References

- **rice-prioritization-guide.md** - Complete RICE methodology
- **customer-discovery-methods.md** - Interview frameworks, synthesis
- **prd_templates.md** - 4 PRD formats with examples
- **product-metrics-frameworks.md** - North Star, funnel analysis, feature metrics

## Best Practices

- Start with customer problems, not solutions
- Use RICE for objective prioritization
- Keep PRDs focused on "why" not "how"
- Measure everything: adoption, frequency, retention

## Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Planning
User: "Help me prioritize our backlog for Q1"
1. Export features to CSV
2. Run rice_prioritizer.py with team capacity
3. Review portfolio balance (quick wins vs big bets)

### Example 2: Interview Synthesis
User: "Analyze these 5 customer interviews"
1. Run analyzer on each transcript
2. Identify common themes across interviews
3. Map to opportunity areas
```

**Result:** 150 lines (58% reduction from 352)

## üîß Implementation Tools & Scripts

### Script 1: Metadata Generator

**Purpose:** Generate consistent metadata for all skills

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/generate_metadata.py --skill content-creator --category marketing --domain content-marketing --tools "brand_voice_analyzer.py, seo_optimizer.py"
```

**Output:**
```yaml
---
name: content-creator
description: [existing description]
license: MIT
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  author: Alireza Rezvani
  category: marketing
  domain: content-marketing
  updated: 2025-10-20
  python-tools: brand_voice_analyzer.py, seo_optimizer.py
---
```

### Script 2: SKILL.md Line Counter

**Purpose:** Track progress on reducing SKILL.md lengths

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/count_skill_lines.py
```

**Output:**
```
Skill Line Count Report:
========================
content-creator: 236 lines (Target: 120) ‚ö†Ô∏è
product-manager-toolkit: 352 lines (Target: 150) ‚ö†Ô∏è
...
Average: 300 lines (Target: 150)
Total SKILL.md lines: 10,800 (Target: 5,400)
```

### Script 3: Reference Link Validator

**Purpose:** Ensure all reference links work after refactoring

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/validate_references.py
```

**Output:**
```
Validating references in all skills...
‚úÖ content-creator: All 5 references valid
‚ùå product-manager-toolkit: Broken link to references/metrics.md
...
```

## üìö Reference Migration Guide

### When to Move Content to References

**Move if:**
- Detailed framework (>50 lines)
- Comprehensive checklists (>20 items)
- Extensive examples (>5 examples)
- Platform-specific details (>30 lines per platform)
- Procedural guides (step-by-step >30 steps)

**Keep in SKILL.md if:**
- Essential workflow (core process)
- Critical decision points
- Quick start examples (2-3)
- Script usage basics
- High-level overview

### Reference File Naming

**Pattern:** `references/[topic]-[type].md`

**Examples:**
- `rice-prioritization-guide.md` (not `rice.md`)
- `brand-voice-detailed-framework.md` (not `brand.md`)
- `social-media-platform-deep-dive.md` (not `social.md`)

**Benefits:**
- Clear what's in the file
- Easy to discover
- Consistent naming

## üìû Support During Refactoring

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "I broke the skill after refactoring"**
- Solution: Revert to backup branch, identify what broke, fix incrementally

**Issue: "Reference links don't work"**
- Solution: Use relative paths: `references/file.md`, not absolute paths

**Issue: "Claude doesn't activate the skill anymore"**
- Solution: Check description has clear triggers, verify YAML syntax valid

**Issue: "Keywords too generic"**
- Solution: Use specific terms users would actually say

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: One Skill at a Time
Don't try to refactor all 36 at once. Do 3-5 per day maximum.

### Tip 2: Test Immediately
After each refactor, test the skill works. Don't batch testing.

### Tip 3: Keep Backups
Tag before major changes: `git tag v1.0-before-refactor-skill-name`

### Tip 4: Reference First
When in doubt, move to references/. You can always move back to SKILL.md if needed.

### Tip 5: User Feedback
Have actual users test refined skills and provide feedback.
