  - Medium: Monthly to bi-annually
  - Low: Less than bi-annually
- **Measurement**: Deployments per day/week/month

## Metric Anti-patterns

### What NOT to Measure

❌ **Lines of Code**: Encourages bloat  
❌ **Hours Worked**: Promotes presenteeism  
❌ **Individual Velocity**: Creates competition  
❌ **Bug Count Without Context**: Discourages risk-taking  
❌ **Commit Count**: Encourages tiny commits  

### Goodhart's Law
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

**Examples**:
- Optimizing test coverage → Writing meaningless tests
- Reducing bug count → Not reporting bugs
- Increasing velocity → Inflating estimates
- Reducing meeting time → Skipping important discussions

### How to Avoid Gaming

1. **Use Multiple Metrics**: No single metric tells the whole story
2. **Focus on Trends**: Not absolute numbers
3. **Combine Leading and Lagging**: Balance predictive and historical
4. **Regular Review**: Adjust metrics that are being gamed
5. **Team Ownership**: Let teams choose their metrics
