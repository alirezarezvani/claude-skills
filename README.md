## üèóÔ∏è Skill Architecture

Each skill package follows a consistent, modular structure:

```
{skill-category}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {skill-name}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                          # Master documentation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                          # Python CLI tools
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {tool_name}.py               # Executable analysis tools
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ references/                       # Knowledge bases
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {framework_name}.md          # Curated guidelines
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                           # User templates
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {template_name}.md           # Ready-to-use templates
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Design Principles

1. **Self-Contained** - Each skill is fully independent and deployable
2. **Documentation-Driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable documentation
3. **Algorithm Over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) when possible for speed and reliability
4. **Template-Heavy** - Provide ready-to-use frameworks users can customize
5. **Platform-Specific** - Focus on specific, actionable advice over generic best practices

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Purpose | Format |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **SKILL.md** | Entry point, workflows, usage instructions | Markdown |
| **scripts/** | Automated analysis and optimization tools | Python CLI |
| **references/** | Expert knowledge, frameworks, guidelines | Markdown |
| **assets/** | Templates for end-user customization | Markdown/YAML |

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Blog Post Optimization

**Scenario:** You've written a blog post and want to optimize it for SEO and brand consistency.

```bash
# Step 1: Check SEO
python marketing-skill/content-creator/scripts/seo_optimizer.py blog-post.md "AI automation"

# Output: SEO Score: 68/100
# Recommendations:
# - Add 3 more mentions of primary keyword (current density: 0.8%, target: 1-2%)
# - Include H2 heading with primary keyword
# - Add 2 internal links
# - Meta description too short (current: 120 chars, target: 150-160)

# Step 2: Check brand voice
python marketing-skill/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py blog-post.md

# Output:
# Formality: 7/10 (Professional)
# Tone: Authoritative, Informative
# Readability: 65 (Standard - college level)
# Recommendations:
# - Reduce sentence length by 15% for better readability
# - Use more active voice (currently 60%, target: 70%+)

# Step 3: Apply fixes in your editor
# Step 4: Re-run analysis to verify improvements
```

### Example 2: LinkedIn Content Calendar

**Using Claude AI:**

1. Upload `marketing-skill/content-creator/SKILL.md`
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Using the content-creator skill, create a 30-day LinkedIn content calendar
   for our B2B SaaS company launching a new marketing automation feature.

   Target audience: Marketing directors at mid-sized companies (50-500 employees)
   Brand voice: Expert + Friendly (from the 5 archetypes)
   Topics: Marketing automation, lead nurturing, ROI measurement
   ```

3. Claude generates:
   - 30-day calendar with post types (how-to, case study, tips, thought leadership)
   - Specific post outlines using content frameworks
   - Optimal posting times based on LinkedIn best practices
   - Hashtag recommendations
   - Engagement strategies

### Example 3: Technical Debt Assessment

**Using Claude Code:**

```bash
# Run tech debt analysis
python c-level-advisor/cto-advisor/scripts/tech_debt_analyzer.py /path/to/codebase

# Claude Code processes results and:
# 1. Identifies top 10 debt items by severity
# 2. Estimates effort to address (hours/days)
# 3. Calculates impact on velocity
# 4. Generates prioritized roadmap
# 5. Creates Jira tickets with detailed descriptions

# Output: Quarterly tech debt reduction plan
```

### Example 4: Board Presentation Prep

**Using CEO Advisor Skill:**

1. Upload `c-level-advisor/ceo-advisor/SKILL.md`
2. Upload `c-level-advisor/ceo-advisor/references/board_governance_investor_relations.md`
3. Prompt:
   ```
   Using the ceo-advisor skill, help me prepare a board presentation for Q4 2025.

   Context:
   - SaaS company, $5M ARR, 40% YoY growth
   - Raised Series A ($10M) 18 months ago
   - Runway: 24 months
   - Key decision: Expand to European market or double-down on US

   Include: Financial summary, strategic options, recommendation, Q&A prep
   ```

4. Claude generates:
   - Structured presentation outline using board governance best practices
   - Financial scenario models for both options
   - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
   - Anticipated board questions with prepared answers
   - Decision framework showing evaluation criteria
