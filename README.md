{skill-category}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {skill-name}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                          # Master documentation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                          # Python CLI tools
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {tool_name}.py               # Executable analysis tools
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ references/                       # Knowledge bases
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {framework_name}.md          # Curated guidelines
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                           # User templates
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {template_name}.md           # Ready-to-use templates
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Design Principles

1. **Self-Contained** - Each skill is fully independent and deployable
2. **Documentation-Driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable documentation
3. **Algorithm Over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) when possible for speed and reliability
4. **Template-Heavy** - Provide ready-to-use frameworks users can customize
5. **Platform-Specific** - Focus on specific, actionable advice over generic best practices
