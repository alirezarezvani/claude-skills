# Atlassian Jira Expert

Master-level expertise in Jira configuration, project management, JQL, workflows, automation, and reporting. Handles all technical and operational aspects of Jira.

## Core Competencies

**Project Configuration**
- Create and configure Jira projects (Scrum, Kanban, custom)
- Design and implement custom workflows
- Configure issue types, fields, and screens
- Set up project permissions and security schemes

**JQL Mastery**
- Write advanced JQL queries for any use case
- Create complex filters with multiple conditions
- Optimize query performance
- Build saved filters for team use

**Automation & Integration**
- Design Jira automation rules
- Configure webhooks and integrations
- Set up email notifications
- Integrate with external tools (Confluence, Slack, etc.)

**Reporting & Dashboards**
- Create custom dashboards with gadgets
- Build reports for sprint metrics, velocity, burndown
- Configure portfolio-level reporting
- Export data for executive reporting

## Workflows

### Project Creation
1. Determine project type (Scrum, Kanban, Bug Tracking, etc.)
2. Create project with appropriate template
3. Configure project settings:
   - Name, key, description
   - Project lead and default assignee
   - Notification scheme
   - Permission scheme
4. Set up issue types and workflows
5. Configure custom fields if needed
6. Create initial board/backlog view
7. **HANDOFF TO**: Scrum Master for team onboarding

### Workflow Design
1. Map out process states (To Do → In Progress → Done)
2. Define transitions and conditions
3. Add validators, post-functions, and conditions
4. Configure workflow scheme
5. Associate workflow with project
6. Test workflow with sample issues
7. **USE**: References for complex workflow patterns

### JQL Query Building
**Basic Structure**: `field operator value`

**Common Operators**:
- `=, !=` : equals, not equals
- `~, !~` : contains, not contains
- `>, <, >=, <=` : comparison
- `in, not in` : list membership
- `is empty, is not empty`
- `was, was in, was not`
- `changed`

**Powerful JQL Examples**:

Find overdue issues:
```jql
dueDate < now() AND status != Done
```

Sprint burndown issues:
```jql
sprint = 23 AND status changed TO "Done" DURING (startOfSprint(), endOfSprint())
```

Find stale issues:
```jql
updated < -30d AND status != Done
```

Cross-project epic tracking:
```jql
"Epic Link" = PROJ-123 ORDER BY rank
```

Velocity calculation:
```jql
sprint in closedSprints() AND resolution = Done
```

Team capacity:
```jql
assignee in (user1, user2) AND sprint in openSprints()
```

### Dashboard Creation
1. Create new dashboard (personal or shared)
2. Add relevant gadgets:
   - Filter Results (JQL-based)
   - Sprint Burndown
   - Velocity Chart
   - Created vs Resolved
   - Pie Chart (status distribution)
3. Arrange layout for readability
4. Configure automatic refresh
5. Share with appropriate teams
6. **HANDOFF TO**: Senior PM or Scrum Master for use

### Automation Rules
1. Define trigger (issue created, field changed, scheduled)
2. Add conditions (if applicable)
3. Define actions:
   - Update field
   - Send notification
   - Create subtask
   - Transition issue
   - Post comment
4. Test automation with sample data
5. Enable and monitor
6. **USE**: References for complex automation patterns

## Advanced Features

### Custom Fields
**When to Create**:
- Track data not in standard fields
- Capture process-specific information
- Enable advanced reporting

**Field Types**:
- Text: Short text, paragraph
- Numeric: Number, decimal
- Date: Date picker, date-time
- Select: Single select, multi-select, cascading
- User: User picker, multi-user picker

**Configuration**:
1. Create custom field
2. Configure field context (which projects/issue types)
3. Add to appropriate screens
4. Update search templates if needed

### Issue Linking
**Link Types**:
- Blocks / Is blocked by
- Relates to
- Duplicates / Is duplicated by
- Clones / Is cloned by
- Epic-Story relationship

**Best Practices**:
- Use Epic linking for feature grouping
- Use blocking links to show dependencies
- Document link reasons in comments

### Permissions & Security

**Permission Schemes**:
- Browse Projects
- Create/Edit/Delete Issues
- Administer Projects
- Manage Sprints

**Security Levels**:
- Define confidential issue visibility
- Control access to sensitive data
- Audit security changes

### Bulk Operations
**Bulk Change**:
1. Use JQL to find target issues
2. Select bulk change operation
3. Choose fields to update
4. Preview changes
5. Execute and confirm
6. Monitor background task

**Bulk Transitions**:
- Move multiple issues through workflow
- Useful for sprint cleanup
- Requires appropriate permissions

## JQL Functions Reference

**Date Functions**:
- `startOfDay()`, `endOfDay()`
- `startOfWeek()`, `endOfWeek()`
- `startOfMonth()`, `endOfMonth()`
- `startOfYear()`, `endOfYear()`

**Sprint Functions**:
- `openSprints()`
- `closedSprints()`
- `futureSprints()`

**User Functions**:
- `currentUser()`
- `membersOf("group")`

**Advanced Functions**:
- `issueHistory()`
- `linkedIssues()`
- `issuesWithFixVersions()`

## Reporting Templates

**Sprint Report**:
```jql
project = PROJ AND sprint = 23
```

**Team Velocity**:
```jql
assignee in (team) AND sprint in closedSprints() AND resolution = Done
```

**Bug Trend**:
```jql
type = Bug AND created >= -30d
```

**Blocker Analysis**:
```jql
priority = Blocker AND status != Done
```
